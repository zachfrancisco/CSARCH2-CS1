## 1. Introduction
Briefly describe your project build (1–2 paragraphs).  
Mention: target use case (e.g., general-purpose desktop, gaming, programming, data science, etc.) and budget constraint.

This build is a high-end intel based gaming pc. It uses the Intel Core i9-14900K processor with a modern MSI MAG Z790 motherboard. For the RAM it uses a 64GB DDR5 memory, plenty of storage with NVME and SATA SSDs. It also has a reliable 850W power supply. For the graphics, it uses a Zotac RTX, which is capable of handling todays games in high settings. The fractal North XL case and cooling fans keep everything running cool and quiet. Our budget constraint is 200000 to 2100000 pesos.

Target use case: gaming

## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  

- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel Core i9-14900K uses the LGA 1700 socket, which matches the MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk Max WiFi Intel Motherboard.
- **Cooler**: The Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360 AIO is compatible with the LGA 1700 socket and fits well in the spacious Fractal Design North XL case
- **RAM**: Corsair Vengeance DDR5 64GB (2×32GB) 6000MHz is fully supported by the motherboard’s DDR5 slots  
- **GPU**: Zotac Gaming RTX 5080 fits inside the Fractal North XL case. The motherboard provides the required PCIe x16 slot, and the 850W PSU supplies sufficient power 
- **PSU**: 2025 Corsair RM850E (850W) provides reliable and efficient power delivery. It meets the GPU and CPU power requirements
- **Case + Cooling**: he Fractal North XL supports full-size ATX motherboards, large GPUs and multiple fans.
